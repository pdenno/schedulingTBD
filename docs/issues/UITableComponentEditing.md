# Table EditCell Cursor Position Fix ✅ COMPLETED

**Issue**: EditCell cursor positioning problem in table.cljs

## Problem Description
When editing table cells, cursor positioning was broken:
- First character typed: inserted correctly at cursor position
- Subsequent characters: jumped to end of text field
- Result: impossible to edit text in middle of cells

## Root Cause
React key management issue in EditCell component:
- Using `:key text` caused component recreation on every text change
- `:defaultValue` with unstable key = cursor position lost

## Solution Applied ✅
1. **Stable Key**: Changed to `:key (str row-id "-" cell-id)` (position-based)
2. **Local State**: Added `[local-text set-local-text] (hooks/use-state text)`
3. **Controlled Component**: Switched from `:defaultValue` to `:value local-text`
4. **Dual Updates**: Local state for UI + table state for persistence

## Files Modified
- `src/app/stbd_app/components/table.cljs` - Applied the fix
- `docs/fixes/table-editcell-cursor-fix.md` - Detailed documentation
- `docs/fixes/README.md` - Created fixes index
