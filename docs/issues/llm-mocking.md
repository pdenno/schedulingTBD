# Project-Based LLM Response Mocking for Testing

## Problem Statement

Currently, testing the SchedulingTBD system is:
- **Slow**: Each LLM call takes 30+ seconds
- **Expensive**: API costs accumulate quickly during testing
- **Non-deterministic**: LLM responses vary between runs
- **Dependent**: Requires internet connectivity and API availability

This makes development iterations tedious and expensive, especially for regression testing and continuous integration.

## Proposed Solution

Implement a **project-based mock system** that uses pre-recorded conversation data from `data/projects/*.edn` files to simulate LLM responses during testing.

### Core Concept

Instead of making live LLM calls during tests, the system would:
1. Detect when running in mock mode.
2. Look up the appropriate response from recorded project conversations.
3. Return the pre-recorded response instantly.
4. Continue the conversation flow as if it were a real LLM interaction.
5. To avoid updates to the project being mocked, starting in mock mode should either (design choice)
    a) create a new in-memory DB using the db/db-schema-proj+ schema (just like projects), or
    b) check that the update exactly replaces text already there. (It our graph DB, this won't change the node ID at all).
6. Mocking is predominantly for the interviewer, interviewee, and orchestrator agents. Other agents and LLM interactions do not have obvious or explicit presence in the DB.

## Concept of Operations (CONOPS)

The complete capability is used by developers and test engineers.

1. The capability is reached as function mock/run-mocking that can be used from the REPL to start mocking.
2. It is possible to pause mocking with a function at the REPL (or just Ctrl-C interrupt the REPL).
3. Sleep for some designated amount between Q/A interactions.


## Concepts for Development

1. Rather trying to match what is in the DB, use the DB to create a script that will drive the mocking.Create a 'script' by studying the project DB.
2. Each message in a project has a :message/time attribute which is a Java Instant. It can be used to order the steps in the script.
3. Relevant messages have a :message/purusing-EADS attribute. This gives information on how
   either inv/ork-review should respond in mocking.

## Benefits

### Development Benefits
- **Instant feedback**: No waiting for LLM responses
- **Cost-free testing**: Zero API charges
- **Deterministic results**: Consistent test outcomes (once completely implemented. In early phases of development only certain agents are mocked.)
- **Offline development**: Work without internet
- **Parallel testing**: Run multiple test suites simultaneously

### Testing Benefits
- **Regression testing**: Verify system behavior with known inputs/outputs
- **Edge case testing**: Use recorded difficult conversations
- **Integration testing**: Test full conversation flows quickly
- **Load testing**: Simulate high conversation volumes without API limits

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Mock Infrastructure
1. **Mock detection**: Add test mode configuration
2. **Response lookup**: Implement project data parsing and response matching
3. **Integration point**: Modify `query-llm` function to support mocking
4. **Basic tests**: Verify mock responses work correctly

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
1. **Response validation**: Ensure mock responses match expected format.
2. **All Agents** : Early implementation only mocks the interviewer, orchestrator, and surrogate interviewee (see surrogate.clj).

### Phase 3: Developer Experience
1. **Test utilities**: Helper functions for setting up mock scenarios
2. **Documentation**: Usage examples and best practices
3. **CI integration**: Automated testing with project-based mocks
4. **Debug tools**: Visualize mock response selection process

## Technical Considerations

### Data Management
- **Project loading**: Efficiently parse and cache project conversation data
- **Response indexing**: Quick lookup of appropriate responses
- **Memory usage**: Handle large project files without performance impact
- **Data integrity**: Ensure mock responses maintain conversation coherence

### Fallback Strategies
- **Missing responses**: Handle cases where no mock response exists
- **Partial conversations**: Continue with live LLM when mock data ends
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation when mock system fails

## Example Usage

### Test Setup
```clojure
(deftest test-process-conversation
  (with-mock-llm "sur-music-school.edn"
    (let [result (start-conversation :process)]
      (is (= expected-flow result)))))
```

### Mixed Mode Testing
```clojure
;; Use mock for initial conversation, live LLM for new variations
(with-mock-llm "craft-beer-brewery.edn" {:partial true}
  (test-conversation-extension))
```

## Success Metrics

- **Test execution time**: Reduce from minutes to seconds
- **API cost reduction**: Eliminate testing-related charges
- **Development velocity**: Faster iteration cycles
- **Test coverage**: More comprehensive testing due to reduced barriers
- **CI reliability**: Consistent test results independent of external services

## Future Enhancements

### Conversation Recording
- Automatically record new conversations as project files
- Version control for conversation datasets
- Merge and diff tools for conversation changes

### Smart Mocking
- ML-based response matching for better context understanding
- Automatic conversation flow validation
- Dynamic response generation based on conversation patterns

### Multi-Modal Support
- Support for different project types and domains
- Cross-project response sharing for common patterns
- Template-based response generation
