# System Overview

## Introduction
This system is part of a scheduling application designed to manage processes and tasks efficiently. It utilizes a variety of tools and logs interactions for monitoring and debugging.

## Architecture Overview
The system is based on a Clojure project structure, leveraging Clojure's tools and capabilities for managing functional components. It includes an integration with machine learning models for processing and decision-making.

## Key Functionalities
- **WebSocket Functions**: Supports various real-time WebSocket operations such as:
  - **`:start-conversation`**: Initiates a new conversation context.
  - **`:resume-conversation`**: Manages ongoing conversation states.
  - **`:load-proj`**: Loads and initializes project-related conversations.
  - **`:domain-expert-says`**: Handles domain expert responses.
  - **`:ask-llm`**: Facilitates interactions with language models for advanced insights.

- **Logging and Monitoring**: Integrated with Telemere for streaming logs and telemetry data.

## Workflow
- The system handles conversations by registering functions with WebSockets.
- Logging is used to track the status and flow of operations, aiding in real-time troubleshooting and historical analysis.

## Integration Points
- **Interop**: Streamlined with Telemere for logging and monitoring.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes models for processing interviews and conversations.

## Logging and Monitoring
- Logs are stored in specified directories and include detailed entries for monitoring workflow status and operations.

## Current Observations
- The server starts on Jetty at port 3300.
- The system uses OpenAI models for certain processing tasks.
- Frequent updates to HTTP handler routes are detected.
