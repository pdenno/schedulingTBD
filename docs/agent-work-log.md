## Current Task: Investigating Interviewer Hypothesis Doubts

**Date:** 2025-06-24  
**Time:** 14:06 UTC

### Context
User expressed doubts about my hypothesis regarding the "real interviewer" but did not specify which hypothesis or what concerns they have.

### Current System Status
From examining recent logs (./logs/agents-log.edn), I can see:

1. **Current Issues with Interviewer System:**
   - Spec assertion failures: `:text :table` value causing validation errors
   - Format definition errors: "Not enough arguments for format definition"
   - ClassCastException in mock system: PersistentArrayMap cannot be cast to Future
   - Multiple repeated attempts to start conversations that are failing

2. **System Currently Working On:**
   - Project: `:sur-craft-beer--temp` 
   - Conversation: `:process`
   - EADS: `process/warm-up-with-challenges`
   - Attempting to ask warm-up question about products/services and scheduling challenges

3. **Mock System Status:**
   - LLM mocking system was recently implemented (completed June 20, 2025)
   - System appears to be using mocking but experiencing errors
   - Some successful responses mixed with errors

### Need Clarification On:
- Which specific hypothesis about the "real interviewer" is in question?
- Is this about the mock vs real LLM interviewer distinction?
- Design assumptions about interviewer behavior?
- Technical implementation concerns?

### Next Steps:
1. Get clarification on specific hypothesis concerns
2. Investigate and potentially fix the current interviewer errors
3. Document findings and proposed solutions
