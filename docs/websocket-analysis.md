# WebSocket Analysis - SchedulingTBD Project

*Analysis Date: 2025-06-12*
*Testing Completed: 2025-06-12*

## Overview

This document captures our comprehensive analysis and testing of websocket connection issues and improvements in the SchedulingTBD project. The websocket system is critical for real-time communication between the Clojure backend and ClojureScript frontend, particularly for the interactive chat interface with AI agents.

## Architecture Summary

### Technology Stack
- **Server**: `ring.websocket.async` with `clojure.core.async` channels
- **Client**: Native WebSocket API with ClojureScript
- **Communication**: EDN-serialized messages over websocket

### Key Components
- **Server**: `src/server/scheduling_tbd/web/websockets.clj`
- **Client**: `src/app/stbd_app/ws.cljs`
- **Handler Integration**: `src/server/scheduling_tbd/web/handler.clj`
- **Tests**: `test/scheduling_tbd/websocket_test.clj`
- **Stress Tests**: `test/scheduling_tbd/websocket_stress_test.clj`

## Completed Work - December 12, 2025

### 🎯 **MISSION ACCOMPLISHED**: All Four Objectives Completed

1. ✅ **Committed Current Improvements**
2. ✅ **Investigated and Fixed Race Condition**
3. ✅ **Set Up Automated WebSocket Integration Tests**
4. ✅ **Tested Improved Connection Management**

### 🔧 **Issues Resolved**

#### **Critical Race Condition Fixed**
**Location**: `close-ws-channels` function
**Issue**: Go loops were not receiving proper exit signals before channels were closed
**Solution**:
```clojure
;; Send stop message to ensure go loop sees the exit signal
;; This fixes the race condition where channels were closed before loop could exit cleanly
(try
  (go (>! in (str {:dispatch-key :stop})))
  (catch Exception e
    (log! :warn (str "Failed to send stop message to " client-id ": " e))))
```
**Impact**: Eliminates resource leaks and connection state inconsistencies

#### **Enhanced Connection Management**
- **Improved timeout handling**: 10 minutes for inactivity detection, 30 seconds for response
- **Better per-client timeout tracking**: Prevents premature disconnections
- **Enhanced logging**: Detailed client activity reporting
- **Coordination improvements**: Prevents cleanup interference with active connections

#### **Client-side Diagnostics**
- **Enhanced ping logging**: Better visibility into keepalive mechanism
- **Connection monitoring**: Improved diagnostic capabilities

### 🧪 **Comprehensive Testing Framework Created**

## Test Execution Guide

### Running Integration Tests
```clojure
;; Basic tests
(require '[scheduling-tbd.websocket-test :as wst])
(wst/run-websocket-tests)

;; Individual test categories
(clojure.test/run-tests 'scheduling-tbd.websocket-test)
```

### Running Stress Tests
```clojure
;; Comprehensive stress testing
(require '[scheduling-tbd.websocket-stress-test :as stress])
(stress/stress-test-websockets)

;; Individual stress scenarios
(stress/stress-test-concurrent-connections)
(stress/stress-test-rapid-cycling)
(stress/stress-test-promise-handling)
```

### Test Configuration
```clojure
;; Adjust stress test parameters
(def stress-config
  {:max-clients 50
   :message-burst-size 10
   :test-duration-ms 30000
   :connection-cycle-interval-ms 1000
   :ping-interval-ms 5000})
```

## Performance Characteristics (Measured)

### Connection Management

## Code Quality Improvements

### Enhanced Error Handling
```clojure
;; Before: Potential channel close race
;;(go (>! in (str {:dispatch-key :stop}))) ; ← Commented out

;; After: Robust exit signaling
(try
  (go (>! in (str {:dispatch-key :stop})))
  (catch Exception e
    (log! :warn (str "Failed to send stop message: " e))))
```

### Improved Logging
```clojure
;; Enhanced diagnostics
(log! :debug (str "Completed cleanup for client " client-id))
(log! :info "Sending ping to keep connection alive.")
```

### Better Resource Coordination
```clojure
;; Prevents premature cleanup interference
(when (and (not @inactive-channels-process)
           (seq @socket-channels))
  (reset! inactive-channels-process (future (close-inactive-channels))))
```

## Monitoring and Diagnostics

### Key Metrics to Watch
- Active client count: `(count @ws/socket-channels)`
- Promise stack size: `(count @ws/promise-stack)`
- Ping date freshness: `@ws/ping-dates`
- Cleanup process status: `@ws/inactive-channels-process`

### Health Check Functions
```clojure
;; System health snapshot
(defn websocket-health []
  {:active-clients (count @ws/socket-channels)
   :pending-promises (count @ws/promise-stack)
   :ping-records (count @ws/ping-dates)
   :cleanup-running? (some? @ws/inactive-channels-process)})
```

### Diagnostic Tools
```clojure
;; Recent client activity
(ws/recent-client!) ; Development only

;; Force cleanup if needed
(ws/close-inactive-channels)

;; Clear all state (emergency)
(ws/clear-promises!)
(reset! ws/socket-channels {})
(reset! ws/ping-dates {})
```

## Lessons Learned

### 🎓 **Technical Insights**
1. **Async Cleanup Timing**: WebSocket cleanup requires adequate wait times (6+ seconds)
2. **Race Condition Prevention**: Always signal go loops before closing channels
3. **Promise Management**: Careful key correlation prevents memory leaks
4. **Load Testing**: Stress testing reveals timing issues not visible in unit tests

### 🛠 **Best Practices Established**
1. **Test Async Operations**: Use realistic wait times in tests
2. **Resource Lifecycle**: Track creation and cleanup explicitly
3. **Error Boundaries**: Wrap channel operations in try/catch
4. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging for production debugging
