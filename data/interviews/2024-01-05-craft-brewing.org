* Overview of the experiment in this .org file
   * [2024-01-05 Fri] experiment.
   * I'm using gpt-4-1104-preview.
   * I haven't investigated the  function / code interpretation / retrieval capabilities of the web UI yet.
     - But I know "code interpretation" is about python.
   * Not sure there is an API exactly for this. =Needs investigation.=
   * After a few minutes with an earlier assistant, I realized I needed the additional _Your answers typically are short, just a few sentences each._
     in the "You are a helpful assistant" thing!
   * [[https://platform.openai.com/playground?assistant=asst_rloUcbsn34Ctajed90ILdGBt&mode=assistant&thread=thread_VYDCgBTyJvpTeKNrMGS8CC0J][URL to this work]] probably only works for my login.
   * I mixed interview elements with concept of operations (CONOPS) explanation/validation.
   * Reading the script: /These are my annotations./  +I should not have said this.+ _emphasis_
     | I reformatted the expert's answer as a table.    |

* Run instructions
/This is what I used when I set up the assistant./
You manage a company that brews craft beer. You are an expert in production of the company's products and management of its supply chains.
You help me by answering questions that will allow us together to build a scheduling systems for your company.
Your answers typically are short, just a few sentences each.

* TBD - The (almost) generic starting question
Please describe the main +production+ scheduling challenge you face.
/We aim to design scheduling systems for production AND services./

** Craft Brewing Terse Expert
The main production scheduling challenge is balancing the demand for various beer types with available brewing capacity,
while also considering the fermentation and aging process times, packaging schedules, and the need to optimize the use of resources
such as labor, equipment, and ingredients.
Additionally, we must manage inventory levels to meet distribution commitments without overproducing, which might lead to excess stock and product spoilage.

* TBD - How many products run simultaneously?
How many products (beers) do you run simultaneously?
 /Here I assume we did a background analysis starting with naming the project./
 /Making separate LLM queries about the thing they are talking about, we decide the "first 5 sentences" describe a well-known process./
 /It being a well known process, we can do a bit more investigation and get our own list of process steps, that we present as a list/
 /of check boxes. If they don't check a box, we might as why./
 /We might also ask whether "all of the above are in the correct order for the process", or some such thing./

** Craft Brewing Terse Expert
/Two things I find annoying here:/
This can vary widely between breweries depending on their size and capabilities,
/(1) generalizing about breweries rather than playing the role requested, and.../
but for the purpose of our system, let’s assume we run 10 different beers simultaneously.
/(2) making modeling choices we want control over! This one isn't a problem because it was what we were going to do, but still./
This would include a mix of year-round offerings and seasonal specialties.
Each of these beers may have different production schedules and resource requirements.
/Also I think that's a red herring; seasonal specialties is just another job./

* TBD - Exercising the homework we did
Is it fair to say that the production steps involve malting, milling, mashing, lautering, boiling, fermenting, brighting, and bottling?
/Proabably should have specified _Y/N would be fine._ and then caught the NO rather than asking directly like I had./

** Craft Brewing Terse Expert
/....Because now I have to keep in mind that the question was essentialy Y/N and and that this is not a YES./
Almost.
The steps you listed are part of the brewing process, but malting is typically not done by the brewery itself; malted grains are usually purchased from a maltster.
The correct steps would be milling, mashing, lautering, boiling (with hops addition), cooling, fermenting, conditioning
(which includes the brightening step in a bright beer tank for clarification), and finally packaging, which could be
bottling, canning, or kegging. Each of these steps has its own timing and equipment requirements.
/I learn something every day; I didn't know about "malsters"; Extra kudos if it is actually true (though we don't really care.)/

* TBD - Principal resources for each step
What is the principal resource used in each of the steps?

** Craft Brewing Terse Expert
Here are the principal resources used in each step of the production process:

 | Task         | Resources                                                                                                                                              |
 |--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | Milling      | The principal resource is the grain mill, which is used to crack the malted grains to prepare them for mashing.                                        |
 | Mashing      | Requires hot water (often referred to as "liquor" in brewing) and the mash tun vessel.                                                                 |
 | Lautering    | Involves the lauter tun, which separates the liquid wort from the spent grains.                                                                        |
 | Boiling      | The brew kettle or copper is the primary vessel, and the resource includes the heat source (often gas or steam) and hops as ingredients.               |
 | Cooling      | A heat exchanger or wort chiller is used to rapidly cool the wort before fermentation.                                                                 |
 | Fermenting   | The primary resources are the fermentation tanks and yeast. Temperature control is also crucial at this stage.                                         |
 | Conditioning | Occurs in conditioning or bright beer tanks where beer matures, clarifies, and carbonation can be adjusted.                                            |
 | Packaging    | The bottling line, canning line, or kegging equipment consists of various machines for cleaning containers, filling, capping or sealing, and labeling. |

 In addition to these equipment-specific resources, ingredients such as water, various malt types, hops,
 yeast, and sometimes adjuncts are essential. Labor and quality-control measures are constant resources throughout all these steps.

* TBD - How long does each step take?
How long do each of these steps take?
/This is part of part of separating the wheat from the chaff (model abstaction over trivial tasks)./
/Because this is a "well-known process", we could have done this in the background, presented it, and ask if they found it objectionable./

** Craft Brewing Terse Expert
The time required for each step can vary based on the beer style, the scale of the operation, and the specific equipment used, but here’s a general guideline

 | Task         | Duration                                                                                                                             |
 |--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | Milling      | Approximately 30 minutes to 1 hour.                                                                                                  |
 | Mashing      | Usually around 1 to 2 hours.                                                                                                         |
 | Lautering    | This can take 1 to 2 hours for the runoff and sparge process.                                                                        |
 | Boiling      | Typically lasts around 1 hour, although some styles may require longer boils.                                                        |
 | Cooling      | Roughly 30 minutes to bring the wort down to yeast pitching temperatures.                                                            |
 | Fermenting   | This phase varies the most, from a few days for some ales, to several weeks for lagers.                                              |
 | Conditioning | Again, highly variable, from a couple of weeks for many ales, to several months for lagers or complex beers like barrel-aged stouts. |
 | Packaging    | Depending on the system, it can range from a few hours to a full day.                                                                |

It's important to note that there will be additional time for setup, transitions, and cleaning between batches.
Moreover, there can be overlapping processes, such as brewing a new batch while another is fermenting.

* TBD - One product at a time?
There is just one product type flowing through each of these steps at a time, right?
/Maybe I shouldn't have asked this until after the next question, which flows better with the previous question about task times./

** Craft Brewing Terse Expert
In most small to medium-sized breweries, typically only one beer type is produced through each of the main brewing stages at a time due to equipment and space limitations.
However, there can be multiple batches at different stages of production simultaneously.
For instance, a new batch could be mashing while another is fermenting and yet another is being packaged.
Larger breweries might have multiple lines and equipment to handle several brews at once, but this is less common for craft breweries.

* TBD - Ask whether we can treat some separate task as one task, name it.
By a wide margin, the lengthy steps are fermenting and conditioning.
As a first attempt at specifying a scheduling system for your operations, would it be okay if
we consider the first few steps (milling, mashing, lautering, boiling, and cooling) as one big step called "preparation"? (Just a Y/N answer would be fine.)

** Craft Brewing Terse Expert
Yes.

* TBD - I ask a Y/N (about WIP) and get a No.
/By convention, "yes" means the planner is on a good plan....Oops!/
/This is another plan step/
+It sounds to me+  that your processes do not have a place to store work-in-process product.
The product must go from one step to the next. Is that correct? (Just a Y/N answer would be fine.)

/Re: +It sounds to me+, we won't anthropomorphize like this! My mistake./

** Craft Brewing Terse Expert
No.

* TBD - Okay, why did you say no? Best part of this scenario!
Okay. Why did you say no?

** Craft Brewing Terse Expert
/If this can't be reconciled, the planner might have to backtrack and repair some of its knowledge./
/The reconciliation requires general domain knowledge, plus knowledge of the production mechanism that we've inferred thus far./
/Generally speaking, this exchanges provides the hardest challenge of the experiment./
/Specifically, TBD's planner (not really it is just me) is on a task to eliminate the possibility of WIP from its model of the production mechanism./
/But sometimes a "machine" can serve as buffer space too! We probably want to treat these two "machines" as utilizing "block after service" discipline./
/In that case, we need to convince the users that our notion of buffering WIP is the thing to run with./
/This can be tricky, because like biotech manufacturing, the "workpiece" isn't just sitting there, it is evolving!/ =NEEDS WORK. Read the user's text!=

I said "No" because there are stages in the brewing process where the product can be stored temporarily before moving on to the next stage.
The most notable are post-boiling and pre-fermentation, where wort can be held in a hot liquor tank if necessary, and post-fermentation,
where beer can be stored in conditioning tanks before it moves to packaging.
Additionally, there can be temporary storage for the wort between lautering and boiling if scheduling demands it,
though this is less ideal due to the risk of infection and quality loss.

/Here we need to enter a plan task to analyze the text with respect to our knowledge of how WIP and buffering work./
/Specifically, there are a few ways we can go here:/
/(1) We can

/Impressive reasoning, reflecting real domain reasoning from Chat-GPT!/
/And as for us??? What does not kill us will make us stronger!/
/...of course it probably WILL kill us for a few months at least.../

* TBD - Resolution of the 1st exception raised by the expert
Is it okay if we consider storage in the hot liquor tank part of the preparation step we talked about? (Y/N would be fine.)

** Craft Brewing Terse Expert
Yes.

* TBD - Resolution of the 2nd exception raised by the expert
Likewise could we consider storage in the conditioning take part of the conditioning step? (Y/N would be fine.)

** Craft Brewing Terse Expert
Yes.

* TBD - Contribute to CONOPS presentation
Okay, then for a first pass at our scheduling system,
I'd like to suggest that we schedule simultaneous batches through preparation, fermentation, conditioning and packaging.
Does that sound about right to you? (Y/N would be fine.)

** Craft Brewing Terse Expert
Yes.

* TBD - How many actual resources?
Great! You said earlier that you could run about 10 products simultaneously.
So that suggests a certain number of principal resources for preparation, fermenting, conditioning, and packaging.
How many of each of those resource do you actually have?

** Craft Brewing Terse Expert
The specific number of resources would depend on our actual facility size and production capacity, but for the sake of this example, let's define it as follows:
/There you go again...Get real!/

Preparation: We might have 2 brewhouses for the preparation step.
Fermenting: We could have around 20 fermentation tanks, allowing for different beers and fermentation times.
Conditioning: Similar to fermentation, we may have 20 conditioning tanks, which also allows for scheduling flexibility.
Packaging: We would typically have 1 packaging line that can be adjusted for bottling, canning, or kegging.
This setup assumes that while we may run 10 different beers, we can have multiple batches of the same beer at different stages.
It's also important to balance tank utilization to ensure continuous production.

* TBD - Batch sizes equal?
Are all your batches the same size?

** Craft Brewing Terse Expert
In a real-world scenario, batch sizes can vary due to different equipment capacities, product demand, and beer styles.
However, for simplicity in scheduling, let's assume that all of our batches are of the same size,
which aligns with a standardized production approach that many breweries adopt for consistency and efficiency.

* TBD - Fermentation tanks all equal size?
Are all your fermentation tanks the same size?

** Craft Brewing Terse Expert
For the sake of simplicity and uniformity in our scheduling system, let's assume that all fermentation tanks are the same size,
allowing any batch to be fermented in any tank without capacity issues.
This is a common scenario for many craft breweries, although in reality, there might be variations.

* TBD - Willing to cerate a hypothetical demand scenario?
Does it make sense to you (in your business) for us to create a hypothetical demand scenario for your beer products?
We will use it to illustrate how the scheduling system works. (A simple Y/N would be fine.)

** Craft Brewing Terse Expert
Yes.

* TBD - request for demand schedule
Great! Provide me with such a demand schedule, naming the product, quantity and date the product is due.
 /Note: Any place where we ask for table oriented-data, we ought allow them to fill it out on-line, or upload a table./
 /We'd display an example table./

** Craft Brewing Terse Expert
Here's a hypothetical demand schedule for our craft beer products:

 | Product              | Quantity    | Due date      |
 |----------------------+-------------+---------------|
 | Amber Ale            | 5000 Liters | May 5, 2023   |
 | IPA (India Pale Ale) | 6000 Liters | May 12, 2023  |
 | Stout                | 3000 Liters | May 19, 2023  |
 | Pilsner              | 4000 Liters | May 26, 2023  |
 | Wheat Beer           | 4500 Liters | June 2, 2023  |
 | Session IPA          | 3500 Liters | June 9, 2023  |
 | Saison               | 2000 Liters | June 16, 2023 |
 | Pale Ale             | 5500 Liters | June 23, 2023 |
 | Porter               | 2500 Liters | June 30, 2023 |
 | Belgian Ale          | 4000 Liters | July 7, 2023  |


This demand schedule is simplified and does not take into account the complexity of managing a dynamic brewing schedule that may include re-brews,
seasonal beers, and variable processing times.

* TBD - Tank capacity differences
 /Here I'm using the word hypothetical in ways I wouldn't bother with a human./
Great! However, I see that you only need 2000 Liters of Saisson, yet 6000 Liters of IPA (India Pale Ale).
Do all your (hypothetical) conditioning and fermenting tanks accommodate 6000 Liters, or do we have to split these up into batches?

** Craft Brewing Terse Expert
For the purposes of this scheduling system, if we’re assuming that all of our tanks are the same size and all batches are of the same size,
then it would be logical to design them to accommodate the maximum typical batch size.
In this case, if we often produce batches of 6000 liters, all the conditioning and fermentation tanks should be able to hold at least this amount.

However, if the tanks are smaller or if variety in batch sizes is common in our brewery, then we would need to split larger batches into multiple tanks or brew them in several runs. For the sake of continuity in our hypothetical scenario, let's say all tanks accommodate 6000 liters, and demand for products less than the tank size would simply mean the tank wouldn't be filled to capacity.

* TBD 1-1 demand schedule item to job?
Is it okay then that we assume for now that there is a one-to-one correspondence between each item in the demand schedule and a batch?
That is, we schedule batches. (A Y/N would be fine.)

** Craft Brewing Terse Expert
Yes.

* TBD - Can you guess what is missing?
Great! But before we can create a hypothetical production +schedule+ /I should have said 'scheduling system' here/ for the hypothetical demand schedule
on the hypothetical resources you described, there is a bit more information we'll need to specify. Can you guess what that is?
 /I'm just playing around here, but I like the response! POWERFUL!/
 /Of course, knowing what is missing is going to be our job. Analyze what we've collected through the interview so far./
 /Generate new

** Craft Brewing Terse Expert
To create an accurate production schedule, we would need the lead time for each production step
(preparation, fermentation, conditioning, and packaging), /Note that it is using my recommendations task names just fine./
the availability of resources (like preparation area, tanks, and packaging lines), and the potential for overlap in production stages.
We also need to consider cleaning times between batches and any maintenance schedules for the equipment.
Additionally, understanding the shelf life of the products and any required lead time for distribution and sales would also be crucial.

* TBD - Instructions for data about running jobs
Great. To get started on this, pretend that there are products occupying some of the resources you have for preparation,
fermentation, conditioning and packaging.
For each such product, tell me
(1) when it started use of a resource
(2) how much longer you expect it will occupy that resource and
(3) how much time you expect it to occupy each downstream resource in its process plan.
In doing this, make up resource names like brightTank3 and fermentationTank7, etc.

** Craft Brewing Terse Expert
Let's create a scenario with products currently in process using a variety of resources: /Yes it really said this./

Product: Farmhouse Ale Resource:
Preparation Area 1
Started: April 12, 2023
Occupancy Duration Remaining: 6 hours
Expected Time in FermentationTank5: 14 days
Expected Time in ConditioningTank4: 21 days
Expected Time in Packaging: 1 day

Product: Chocolate Stout
Resource: FermentationTank7
Started: April 4, 2023
Occupancy Duration Remaining: 3 days
Expected Time in ConditioningTank6: 28 days
Expected Time in Packaging: 1 day

Product: Citrus IPA
Resource: ConditioningTank2
Started: March 28, 2023
Occupancy Duration Remaining: 7 days
Expected Time in Packaging: 1 day

Product: Honey Brown Lager
Resource: Packaging Line
Started: April 15, 2023, 09:00 AM
Occupancy Duration Remaining: 4 hours (presumably finished the same day)

The process schedule for each product considers the next available resource for each stage.
Also, keep in mind that there will be turnaround times for cleaning and setup when moving from one stage to the next.

* TBD - Ask for task times for the new jobs
Super. Now provide processing times for preparation, fermenting, conditioning, and packaging for the 10 products in the demand schedule you provided earlier.

** Craft Brewing Terse Expert
Below are the processing times for preparation, fermenting, conditioning, and packaging for the 10 products in the demand schedule:

Amber Ale
Preparation: 8 hours
Fermenting: 14 days
Conditioning: 10 days
Packaging: 1 day

IPA (India Pale Ale)
Preparation: 8 hours
Fermenting: 7 days
Conditioning: 14 days
Packaging: 1 day

Stout
Preparation: 8 hours
Fermenting: 21 days
Conditioning: 28 days
Packaging: 1 day

Pilsner
Preparation: 8 hours
Fermenting: 14 days
Conditioning: 30 days (to ensure a crisp profile)
Packaging: 1 day

Wheat Beer
Preparation: 8 hours
Fermenting: 10 days
Conditioning: 14 days
Packaging: 1 day

Session IPA
Preparation: 8 hours
Fermenting: 7 days
Conditioning: 10 days
Packaging: 1 day

Saison
Preparation: 8 hours
Fermenting: 14 days
Conditioning: 21 days
Packaging: 1 day

Pale Ale
Preparation: 8 hours
Fermenting: 7 days
Conditioning: 14 days
Packaging: 1 day

Porter
Preparation: 8 hours
Fermenting: 14 days
Conditioning: 21 days
Packaging: 1 day

Belgian Ale
Preparation: 8 hours
Fermenting: 21 days
Conditioning: 28 days
Packaging: 1 day

These times are hypothetical and can vary based on recipe specifics, yeast performance, beer style, and other factors.
Packaging duration is estimated for a full day to account for setup, potential delays, and changeovers if applicable.

* TBD - More CONOPS
Super.
The first draft of the scheduling system we will build together will schedule product so that the product finishes the last step of the
production process (packaging) a few days before it is to be shipped to customers.
You will be able to specify for each product how many days before shipment you will want it to be ready. Does all of this sound okay to you?

** Craft Brewing Terse Expert
Yes, this approach sounds reasonable.
It allows for a buffer period to handle any unforeseen delays in production and ensures that the product is ready for distribution in a timely manner.
This can also provide additional time for the product to settle post-packaging and for organizing logistics for shipment.

* Summary Thoughts
  * This experiment only depicts
    1) requirements elicitation,
    2) some hints at the production mechanism being inferred,
    3) a suggestion about what the objective function is, and
    4) some contribution to a concept of operations presentation to validate our approach with the user.
  * That said, my intuition suggests that's the hardest part.
  * I'm fairly confident I can generate MiniZinc with what we've collected.
  * I'll use this for a foray into implementing the code, which is looking more and more like an
    HTN planner paired with "value of information" (VoI) assessment for plan search.
    - I'll use my ExplainLib code for VoI.
    - I've used SHOP for HTN planning before and I've implemented its planning language in a datalog DB recently.
      + I'll keep the language but role my own planner using some libraries and the implemented planning language.
