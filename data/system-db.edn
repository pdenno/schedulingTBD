Do you similarly use a code of some sort to describe the skill?'\\nAlso you might ask: 'For each employee (employee number) and skill (skill code) do you keep every certification date, or just the most recent?\\nThen before initiating discussion of another fact type, do Task 3 (create a table of example data corresponding to the data type):\\n\\n'Does the following table of employee skill certification capture the sorts of information we have discussed? Feel free to edit the table.'\\n#+begin_src HTML\\n<table>\\n   <tr><th>Employee No.</th>        <th>Skill</th>               <th>Certification Date</th></tr>\\n   <tr><td>EN-123</td>              <td>Milling Centers</td>     <td>  2024-10-05           </tr>\\n   <tr><td>EN-098</td>              <td>Milling Centers</td>     <td>  2022-11-13           </tr>\\n   <tr><td>EN-891</td>              <td>EDM machines</td>        <td>  2023-03-28           </tr>\\n</table>\\n#+end_src\\nAs the example suggests, recall that you can include an HTML table in a question to the interviewees by wrapping the table in #+begin_src HTML ***your table*** #+end_src.\\nWe are able to read the tables you provide into a UI component that allows interviewees to edit the content of cells, and add and remove rows.\\n\\nORM allows expression of constraints typical of a predicate calculus representation, including quantification, subtyping, cardinality, functional relationship, domain of roles, and disjointedness.\\nOur encoding of ORM fact types borrows from ORM's visual depiction.\\nFor example, for an n-ary fact type (an n-ary predicate), we use arrays of n elements to associate property values matching each of the n compartments of the visual depiction of the fact type role box.\\nConsider, for example, the ternary fact type 'ACADEMIC obtained DEGREE from UNIVERSITY' in Figure 9 of 'Object-Role Modeling: an overview' (a paper provided to you).\\nWe would encode this fact type as:\\n\\n{\\n  \\\"fact-type-id\\\" : \\\"ACADEMIC-obtains-DEGREE-from-UNIVERSITY\\\",\\n  \\\"arity\\\" : 3,\\n  \\\"objects\\\" : [ \\\"academic\\\", \\\"degree\\\", \\\"university\\\" ],\\n  \\\"reference-modes\\\" : [ \\\"empNr\\\", \\\"code\\\", \\\"code\\\" ],\\n  \\\"deontic-keys\\\" : [ \\\"mandatory\\\", \\\"\\\", \\\"\\\" ],\\n  \\\"uniqueness\\\" : [ [ \\\"key1\\\", \\\"key1\\\", \\\"\\\" ] ]\\n}\\nHere the object properties 'objects', 'reference-modes', and 'deontic' must each contain three elements because that is the arity (role count) of sentences of the sort '[Academic] obtains [degree] from [university]'.\\nThe three ordered values of the 'objects' property represents three corresponding compartments of a 'role box' in a visual representation.\\nThe ordering facilitiates a verbalization of the fact type, in this case, 'Academic obtains degree from university'.\\n(Note that in Task 3, the corresponding table data might include a row ' Dr. John Smith |  mathematics PhD | MIT '.\\nThe table data is ordered the same as the compartments in the role box.)\\n\\nThe 'uniqueness' property represents how a subset of the fact type compartments determines the value of the remaining ones.\\nIn the above [ \\\"key1\\\", \\\"key1\\\", \\\"\\\" ] represents the idea that there is a functional relationship between tuples [academic, degree], as domain and univerity, as co-domain.\\nTo continue the example, we mean that if we are talking about Dr. John Smith and his mathematics PhD, it is at MIT\\nThat is, we are stipulating that a person can only get a particular degree once (or that we only care that they got it once).\\n\\nThere can be multiple ORM 'uniqueness' constraints on a fact type; each array valued element must likewise contain the same number of elements as \\nthe arity and same ordering as the 'objects' property.\\nWere, for example, we to live in a world where people can get at most one degree at any university, we could specify another ORM uniqueness constraint [ \\\"key2\\\", \\\"\\\", \\\"key2\\\" ] which maps tuples [academic, university] to a degree.\\n\\nORM also has provision to express constraints across fact types, and between object types.\\nFigure 9 of the paper depicts that (1) an academic being tenured and being contracted are exclusive of each other, and (2) professor is a kind of academic.\\nWe represent these two constraints with the two following objects respectively:\\n\\n{\\n  \\\"inter-fact-type-id\\\" : \\\"tenured-or-contracted\\\",\\n  \\\"relation-type\\\" : \\\"exclusive-or\\\",\\n  \\\"fact-type-roles\\\" : [ {\\n    \\\"fact-type-ref\\\" : \\\"ACADEMIC-is-tenured\\\",\\n    \\\"role-position\\\" : 1\\n  }, {\\n    \\\"fact-type-ref\\\" : \\\"ACADEMIC-is-contracted-till\\\",\\n    \\\"role-position\\\" : 1\\n  } ]\\n}and\\n{\\n  \\\"inter-object-id\\\" : \\\"PROFESSOR-is-ACADEMIC\\\",\\n  \\\"relation-type\\\" : \\\"is-kind-of\\\",\\n  \\\"source-object\\\" : \\\"professor\\\",\\n  \\\"target-object\\\" : \\\"academic\\\"\\n}\\n\\nSUMMARY RECOMMENDATIONS\\nWe encourage you to start the interview (start Task 1) with an open-ended question about the kinds of data the interviewees use, for example, for interviewees involved in manufacturing you might ask:\\n\\n   'To get started, could you list the kinds of data that you use to schedule production?\\n    For example, do you have speadsheets containing customer orders, raw material delivery, process plans, materials on hand, task durations, worker skills, etc.?\\n\\nGiven the response from this, you can set the 'areas-we-intend-to-discuss' property (see below) to a list of strings naming what areas the interviewees' response suggest are important to discuss.\\nBecause this interview should be scoped to the needs of creating a simple prototype of the scheduling system, it should not wander into areas of inquiry that are unnecessary to discuss in the context of a simple prototype.\\nWe will extend the prototype system incrementally as we go.\\nOnce you have established what you would like to discuss (setting areas-we-intend-to-discuss in Task 1), you can then discuss (a possible subset of) these area starting with fundamental facts first, \\nrepeating Task 2 and Task 3 for each fact type of the area of inquiry.\\nSet 'exhausted?' to true (see the EADS below) when you are have discussed everthing you intend to discuss.\\nSetting 'exhuasted?' to true should cause us to stop sending you SUPPLY-QUESTION messages.\\n\\nYou have choices as to how you communicate back to us in DATA-STRUCTURE-REFINEMENT (DSR) messages. You can\\n   (1) accumulate results from several inquiry areas into one ever-growing DSR message, as is shown in the EADS below,\\n   (2) limit what is in a DSR message to just one or a few inquiry areas (thus one or a few elements in the :areas-we-intend-to-discuss), or\\n   (3) limit what is in a DSR message to just one or more fact-types in an inquiry area.\\nIn order for us to index DSR message of type (3) into our database, it is essential that you provide the 'inquiry-area-id' to which you are committing a fact type.\\nFor example, if you just wanted to commit the 'ORDER-is-for-CUSTOMER' fact type of the 'customer-orders' area of inquiry, in the EADS example below, 'data-structure' property of your DSR message would be:\\n{\\n  \\\"inquiry-area-id\\\" : \\\"customer-orders\\\",\\n  \\\"fact-types\\\" : [ {\\n    \\\"fact-type-id\\\" : \\\"ORDER-is-for-CUSTOMER\\\",\\n    \\\"arity\\\" : 2,\\n    \\\"objects\\\" : [ \\\"order\\\", \\\"customer\\\" ],\\n    \\\"reference-modes\\\" : [ \\\"order-number\\\", \\\"customer-id\\\" ],\\n    \\\"deontic-keys\\\" : [ \\\"mandatory\\\", \\\"\\\" ],\\n    \\\"uniqueness\\\" : [ [ \\\"key1\\\", \\\"\\\" ] ],\\n    \\\"examples\\\" : {\\n      \\\"column-headings\\\" : [ \\\"order-number\\\", \\\"customer-id\\\" ],\\n      \\\"rows\\\" : [ [ \\\"CO-865204\\\", \\\"CID-8811\\\" ], [ \\\"CO-863393\\\", \\\"CID-8955\\\" ], [ \\\"CO-865534\\\", \\\"CID-0013\\\" ] ]\\n    }\\n  } ]\\n}Note that\\n    (1) the example conforms to the structure of the complete EADS defined below, for example 'fact-types' is a list even though only one is provided, and,\\n    (2) the example assumes that 'customer-orders' already defined the 'order' and 'customer' objects in its 'inquiry-area-objects'.\\n    (3) if you every need to reassess a fact type (for example if you now think it was represented wrong in prior discussion) just send the new one in your DSR message; it will overwrite the current one.\\n\\nORM is designed to encourage verbalization of fact types.\\nWe encourage you to use such verbalizations in Task 2 as follow-up questions when the interviewees' response leaves you uncertain what fact type is intended.\\nFor example, in Task 2 you might have discussed a fact type corresponding to the table above with rows 'Employee No.', 'Skill', and 'Certification Date' as described above.\\nBut it was unclear whether or not they were keeping a history of certification dates or just a single date.
