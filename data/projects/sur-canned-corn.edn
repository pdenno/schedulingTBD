                                 "Our most significant scheduling problem involves coordinating the raw corn supply with the production line schedules for canning while also aligning with the delivery schedules for our clients. The raw corn must be processed shortly after harvest to preserve freshness, but fluctuating harvest times and quantities make it challenging to align with our predetermined production schedules. Additionally, ensuring the finished goods are delivered on time to our clients, who have varying delivery schedules, adds another layer of complexity. Balancing these aspects to minimize waste, reduce storage costs, and meet client demands efficiently is our main scheduling challenge."}],
