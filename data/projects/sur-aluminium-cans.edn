The challenge lies in ensuring that raw materials, primarily aluminium, arrive in sync with our production cycles to maintain an efficient and continuous manufacturing process. Meanwhile, we must schedule the distribution of the finished cans in a way that aligns with our clients' demands, which often fluctuate seasonally. This necessitates a dynamic scheduling system that can adjust to variations in delivery times, production rates, and client orders, while minimizing storage costs and avoiding production delays."}],

After can forming, the cans undergo a rigorous quality control process to ensure they meet our standards. Once approved, the cans are packaged into larger containers for shipping.
