Due to seasonality and sudden shifts in consumer preferences, it can be challenging to align production capacity with demand without resulting in overproduction or stockouts. Additionally, ensuring that the necessary ingredients, some of which are perishable or sourced seasonally, are available at the right time adds complexity to the scheduling process.",
