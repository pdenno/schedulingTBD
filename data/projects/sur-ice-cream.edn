                                     "Our most significant scheduling problem relates to balancing production line availability with fluctuating demand and ingredient supply. We experience seasonal peaks in demand, particularly in the summer months, requiring careful planning to maximize production efficiency and minimize downtime. Additionally, the variability in the arrival of raw materials, such as milk and fruits, can disrupt production schedules if not managed precisely. This requires a flexible yet robust scheduling system that can adapt to both predictable and unexpected changes effectively.",

This mixture is then pasteurized and homogenized to ensure safety and consistency. After cooling, we add flavors and inclusions such as chocolate chips or fruit pieces. The mixture is then frozen while being churned to incorporate air and achieve the desired texture. Finally, the ice cream is packaged into various container sizes, from individual servings to large tubs, and stored in freezers before distribution.

In MAKE-TO-STOCK you make product to replenish inventory based on forecasted demand. In MAKE-TO-ORDER you make product because a customer has specifically asked you to, and the customer has described characteristics of the product in your own terminology, perhaps using your catalog of offerings. ENGINEER-TO-ORDER is something like MAKE-TO-ORDER but here the customer also expects you to do some creative problem solving to meet their need. For example, a commercial aircraft might be ENGINEER-TO-ORDER because though the customer may have specified the engine type and seating capacity it wants, it is relying on you to determine how to best accommodate the engine and arrange the seats. Other examples of ENGINEER-TO-ORDER include general contracting for building construction, film production, event planning, and 3rd party logisistics. Respond with just one of the terms MAKE-TO-STOCK, MAKE-TO-ORDER or ENGINEER-TO-ORDER according to which most accurately describes your mode of production. ",
