With that done, you would add some filling to one wafer and place another wafer on top. Were the cookie bakers to create a list we seek from you, using their process step list (which had 5 steps) it would look like this:\n\n1. Make Cookie Dough (flour, water, eggs, sugar, chocolate chips)\n2. Make Filling (sugar, water vanilla flavoring)\n3. Bake Wafers (use dough from Make Cookie Dough)\n4.
