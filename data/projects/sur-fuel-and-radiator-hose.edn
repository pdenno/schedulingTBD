                                     "Earlier, you listed the process steps typically used in making product (e.g. 1. Extrude Hoses, 2. Cut Hoses to Length, etc.) and for each you specified typical durations. Now we'd like you to tell us what raw materials and intermediate products go into those process steps. For example, if you were making sandwich cookies, you might simultaneously make the dough for the wafers and make the filling. You might then place the dough in molds and bake to produce wafers. With that done, you would add some filling to one wafer and place another wafer on top. Were the cookie bakers to create a list we seek from you, using their process step list (which had 5 steps) it would look like this:\n\n1. Make Cookie Dough (flour, water, eggs, sugar, chocolate chips)\n2. Make Filling (sugar, water vanilla flavoring)\n3. Bake Wafers (use dough from Make Cookie Dough)\n4. Assemble Cookies (use wafers from Bake Wafers, use filling from Make Filling)\n5. Package (use cookies from Assemble Cookies)",
