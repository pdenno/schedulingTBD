The scheduling needs to account for the availability of raw materials, machinery maintenance schedules, labor shifts, and delivery deadlines. Additionally, any unexpected downtime or delays need to be swiftly addressed to minimize disruptions in the supply chain. Balancing all these factors to ensure smooth and efficient operations is a complex challenge."}],
