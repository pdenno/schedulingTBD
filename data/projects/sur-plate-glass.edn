The mixture is then melted in a furnace at extremely high temperatures to form molten glass. This molten glass is then floated on a bed of molten tin in a float bath, creating a continuous ribbon of glass with uniform thickness. The glass ribbon is cooled gradually in a lehr (annealing oven) to relieve internal stresses. After cooling, the glass is cut to the desired sizes according to client orders. Finally, the cut glass undergoes quality checks and is packed for shipping. Maintenance and cleaning of the equipment, especially the float bath and the furnace, are critical and scheduled regularly to ensure quality and safety."}],
