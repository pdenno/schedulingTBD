                                     "One of our most significant scheduling problems is managing the synchronization between production schedules and raw material supply. Due to the variability in demand, lead times, and the complexity of our supply chain, it's challenging to ensure that all necessary raw materials are available just in time for production without overstocking, which can increase holding costs. Furthermore, unexpected equipment downtimes or maintenance can disrupt production plans, causing delays and requiring quick rescheduling to meet delivery commitments.",

First, we prepare the raw materials, primarily silica sand, soda ash, and limestone, which are melted together in a furnace at high temperatures. The molten glass is then floated on a bed of molten tin, in a process known as the float glass method, which ensures a uniform thickness and smooth surface. After shaping and cooling, the glass undergoes annealing to relieve internal stresses. Finally, the glass is cut to size, inspected for quality, and packaged for delivery. Each stage requires precise timing and control to ensure product quality and minimize waste.",

In MAKE-TO-STOCK you make product to replenish inventory based on forecasted demand. In MAKE-TO-ORDER you make product because a customer has specifically asked you to, and the customer has described characteristics of the product in your own terminology, perhaps using your catalog of offerings. ENGINEER-TO-ORDER is something like MAKE-TO-ORDER but here the customer also expects you to do some creative problem solving to meet their need. For example, a commercial aircraft might be ENGINEER-TO-ORDER because though the customer may have specified the engine type and seating capacity it wants, it is relying on you to determine how to best accommodate the engine and arrange the seats. Other examples of ENGINEER-TO-ORDER include general contracting for building construction, film production, event planning, and 3rd party logisistics. Respond with just one of the terms MAKE-TO-STOCK, MAKE-TO-ORDER or ENGINEER-TO-ORDER according to which most accurately describes your mode of production. ",
