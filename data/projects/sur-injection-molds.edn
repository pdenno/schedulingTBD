                                 "Our most significant scheduling problem revolves around aligning our production capacity with the fluctuating demand for different types of injection molds we manufacture. The lead times for materials procurement and the actual production process vary substantially depending on the complexity and size of the molds. Additionally, we have a limited capacity in terms of machinery and skilled labor which can lead to bottlenecks. Managing these variables to ensure on-time delivery while maximizing our production efficiency and reducing idle times is a complex challenge that we face on a regular basis."}],

Once the design is approved, we move onto procuring the necessary materials, primarily high-grade metals. The bulk of the mold is then formed using CNC machining for precise cuts and shapes, followed by EDM for intricate details and geometries. Post machining, the mold undergoes polishing and finishing to achieve the required surface quality. If the mold consists of multiple components, they are assembled together. Before shipping, the mold is subjected to rigorous testing and quality control checks to ensure it meets the specified standards. This comprehensive process ensures our molds meet the high expectations of durability and precision our customers have come to expect."}],
