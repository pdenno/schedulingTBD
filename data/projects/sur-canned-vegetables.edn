The challenge arises from the variability in harvest times due to weather conditions, the availability of transportation, and the capacity constraints of our processing facilities. We need a scheduling system that can dynamically adjust to these fluctuating factors to ensure a continuous supply of products without overburdening any part of our supply chain. This system must also account for the shelf life of different vegetables to prioritize processing based on perishability."}],
