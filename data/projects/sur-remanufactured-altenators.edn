We face frequent delays in receiving key components such as bearings and voltage regulators, which disrupts our assembly line schedules. Additionally, we have to accommodate last-minute orders and changes in customer demand, making it challenging to optimize production efficiency and lead times. The variance in component arrival and the need for adaptive scheduling often result in either underutilization of our workforce or bottlenecks that delay shipments.",

ENGINEER-TO-ORDER is something like MAKE-TO-ORDER but here the customer also expects you to do some creative problem solving to meet their need. For example, a commercial aircraft might be ENGINEER-TO-ORDER because though the customer may have specified the engine type and seating capacity it wants, it is relying on you to determine how to best accommodate the engine and arrange the seats. Other examples of ENGINEER-TO-ORDER include general contracting for building construction, film production, event planning, and 3rd party logisistics.
