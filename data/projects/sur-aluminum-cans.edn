In MAKE-TO-ORDER you make product because a customer has specifically asked you to, and the customer has described characteristics of the product in your own terminology, perhaps using your catalog of offerings. ENGINEER-TO-ORDER is something like MAKE-TO-ORDER but here the customer also expects you to do some creative problem solving to meet their need. For example, a commercial aircraft might be ENGINEER-TO-ORDER because though the customer may have specified the engine type and seating capacity it wants, it is relying on you to determine how to best accommodate the engine and arrange the seats. Other examples of ENGINEER-TO-ORDER include general contracting for building construction, film production, event planning, and 3rd party logisistics. Respond with just one of the terms MAKE-TO-STOCK, MAKE-TO-ORDER or ENGINEER-TO-ORDER according to which most accurately describes your mode of production. ",
