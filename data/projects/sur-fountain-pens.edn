With that done, you would add some filling to one wafer and place another wafer on top. Were the cookie bakers to create a list we seek from you, using their process step list (which had 5 steps) it would look like this:\n\n 1. Make Cookie Dough (flour, water, eggs, sugar, chocolate chips)\n 2. Make Filling (sugar, water vanilla flavoring)\n 3. Bake Wafers (use dough from Make Cookie Dough)\n 4. Assemble Cookies (use wafers from Bake Wafers, use filling from Make Filling)\n 5. Package (use cookies from Assemble Cookies)",
