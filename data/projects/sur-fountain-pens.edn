                     "Our most significant scheduling problem is efficiently managing the production timeline of our fountain pens to meet fluctuating market demand. We often face challenges in aligning the procurement of materials, the manufacturing process, and the assembly line optimization to ensure timely delivery. Additionally, managing labor shifts and machinery maintenance schedules without disrupting production flow adds another layer of complexity. This sometimes leads to either overproduction, leading to excess inventory, or underproduction, leading to missed sales opportunities.",
