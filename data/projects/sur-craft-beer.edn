Poor-performing suppliers may be replaced or limited to lower-priority ingredients.\n- <b>Alternate Supplier Arrangements:</b> For ingredients with no substitutes (e.g., specific hops), we establish relationships with multiple suppliers to reduce risks of disruptions. Preferred suppliers are prioritized for regular orders.\n- <b>Bulk Orders vs. Just-in-Time:</b> Decisions about ordering in bulk (to save on costs) versus just-in-time procurement (to reduce storage needs) are made based on ingredient shelf life and production schedules.\n- <b>Pricing Fluctuations:</b> Seasonal price increases, especially for limited-availability ingredients, can affect procurement timing and budget constraints.\n- <b>Logistics Challenges:</b> Delays in transportation or customs clearance (for imported ingredients) sometimes require adjustments to production schedules.\n\nThese considerations require tight coordination between procurement and production teams to minimize disruptions."}

However, the interviewers may ask you provide a table or add information to a table that the interviewer provides.\nIn these cases, respond with an HTML table wrapped in #+begin_src HTML ... #+end_src\nAll the tables you generate / complete should have the header as the first table row.\nFor example if you were asked to generate / complete a table about process durations for process steps you might respond with:\n\"Here are my estimates of the step durations. Note that I added --Yet another step-- which I think should be included in this context:\"\n\n#+begin_src HTML\n<table>\n  <tr><th>Process Step</th>                <th>Duration</th></tr>\n  <tr><td>--Some step--</td>               <td>2 hours</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>--Some other step--</td>         <td>3 days</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>--Yet anoter step--</td>         <td>1 days</td></tr>\n</table>\n#+end_src",
