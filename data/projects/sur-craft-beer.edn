                                 "Our most significant scheduling problem involves balancing the intricate timing of our brewing cycles with fluctuating demand and supply chain challenges. Brewing craft beer is a nuanced process with different phases, each requiring precise timing, from brewing to fermentation, conditioning, and finally bottling. Additionally, we face unpredictable demand shifts and occasional delays in raw material deliveries, which often disrupt our planned production schedules. This all combines to create a complex scheduling puzzle, making it challenging to optimize production efficiency and meet market demands reliably."}],

Following brewing, the wort is cooled and transferred to fermentation tanks, where yeast is added and the fermentation process begins. This phase is crucial as it converts sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. After fermentation, the beer undergoes conditioning, a phase that helps develop flavors and removes unwanted compounds. Finally, the beer is filtered (if necessary) and then bottled, making it ready for distribution. Each phase has its specific duration and conditions, requiring precise scheduling and monitoring to ensure the quality of the final product."}],
