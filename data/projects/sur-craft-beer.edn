                     "Our most significant scheduling problem revolves around the brewing, fermentation, and packaging processes, which are highly time-dependent and require precise scheduling to ensure product quality. Each beer type has its own specific timeline that needs to be strictly followed. We often struggle with aligning the availability of necessary resources (e.g., raw materials, equipment, labor) with these timelines, especially when dealing with multiple beer types simultaneously. This can lead to bottlenecks, production delays, and, in some cases, compromised product quality.",

                     "Our production process involves several key steps:\n\n1. <b>Mashing:</b> Mixing milled grains (usually malted barley) with water and heating the mixture. This step extracts sugars from the grains, creating a sugary liquid known as \"wort.\"\n   \n2. <b>Boiling:</b> The wort is boiled, and hops are added for flavor, aroma, and bitterness. This step also sterilizes the wort.\n\n3. <b>Cooling:</b> After boiling, the wort is rapidly cooled down to a temperature suitable for fermentation.\n\n4. <b>Fermentation:</b> The cooled wort is transferred to fermentation tanks, where yeast is added. The yeast ferments the sugars in the wort, producing alcohol and carbon dioxide. This can take from a few days to several weeks, depending on the beer type.\n\n5. <b>Conditioning:</b> After fermentation, the beer is conditioned to develop its full flavor profile. This can happen in the same tank or by transferring the beer to a new tank. \n\n6. <b>Packaging:</b> The final step is packaging the beer into cans, bottles, or kegs for distribution. \n\nEach of these steps requires specific time intervals and conditions (e.g., temperature) to ensure the production of high-quality beer.",
