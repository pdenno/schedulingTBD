                                     "Our scheduling goal is to balance production efficiency with flexibility to meet dynamic customer demand. While minimizing the makespan—finishing all production as quickly as possible—is important to maximize throughput, we also prioritize maintaining high product quality and minimizing production downtime through regular machine maintenance. An ideal schedule allows us to accommodate last-minute orders or changes in demand without disrupting existing production timelines, ensuring that resources, including personnel and equipment, are utilized effectively. Keeping inventory levels balanced to reduce storage costs while having enough product to fulfill orders promptly is also crucial to our scheduling strategy.",
