 "Using the three property types 'problem-type', 'continuous?', and 'cyclical?', determine the kind of production system and scheduling problem for which the interviewees seek a solution.\nFor 'problem-type' you may only choose one of the following:\n   1) FLOW-SHOP-SCHEDULING-PROBLEM: the problem of defining start times for jobs that all execute the same sequence of production steps across multiple machines or workstations.\n   2) RESOURCE-ASSIGNMENT-PROBLEM: [not exactly a scheduling problem, but it might come up] the problem of assigning work to resources without necessarily specifying the time at which the work is to occur.\n   3) PROJECT-SCHEDULING-PROBLEM:  the problem of defining start and finish dates to all activities, deliverables, and milestones within an undertaking.\n   4) JOB-SHOP-SCHEDULING-PROBLEM: the problem of scheduling jobs where the order in which the jobs visit machines or workstations may vary as determined by the job type.\n   5) SINGLE-MACHINE-SCHEDULING-PROBLEM: the problem of choosing the sequence by which each of several jobs use the same resource or set of resources.",

   "We asked interviewees a few questions about their operations (not shown here) and inferred that they operate a flow shop."},
  "continuous?":
  {"val":false,
   "comment":
   "continuous? refers to whether or not product flows continuously from one process to the next, as it does in, for example, production of many petroleum products.\nThis might be apparent from the answers that determined the value of problem-type. If not, then you can ask."},
  "cyclical?":
  {"val":false,
   "comment":
   "cyclical? refers to whether or not they seek a system that creates schedules that can be repeated in a pattern.\nFor example, if the made the same collection of products in the same order each week, cylical? would be true."}}}
