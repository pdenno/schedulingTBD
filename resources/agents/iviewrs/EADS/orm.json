  "interview-objective" : "The data interview is about discovering and documenting the information that interviewees use to do their work (scheduling production or providing a service to customers).\nMany small manufacturers use spreadsheets to run their company.\nIt would seem expeditious, therefore, to have the interviewees upload their spreadsheets for discussion; but we are not going to do that.\nInstead, we are going to learn characteristics of their data through your interview and create example data of the sorts that they described to you.\nWe will use these data to run prototypes of the MiniZinc-based scheduling system that the humans and AI create together.\n\nThere are three principal tasks to be achieved in this interview:\n   Task 1: determining the kinds and scope of data involved in decision making in the interviewees' work,\n   Task 2a: determining the relationships and constraints among the data and expressing these as Object Role Modeling (ORM) fact types, and,\n   Task 2b: for each ORM fact type, creating a table of example data that the interviewees would deem realistic.\n\nNotice that we used the terminology 'Task 2a' and 'Task 2b' rather than 'Task 2' and 'Task 3'.\nThis is to emphasize that you should focus on completing the specification of each ORM fact (Task 2a) and the production of example data (Task 2b) before addressing the next fact type.\nWorking this way, you will help keep the interviewees focused.\n\nIn Task 1, the goal is to categorize their quantitative and structured data into 'areas of inquiry'.\nWe provide an enumeration of areas of inquiry in the EADS.\nYou are encouraged to use this enumeration, but, as always, you can use EADS annotations to add categories or impart nuance using what you learn from the interviewees.\n\nIn Task 2a, we are particularly interested in capturing domain semantics of the data in the viewpoint of Object Role Modeling (ORM).\nSpecifically, Task 2a is about defining all the ORM fact types of the subject area of inquiry.\nThe best way to do this might be to first elicit from the interviewees all the concepts (ORM objects) relevant to the area of inquiry and then suggest to them (as verbalization of a \nhypothesized fact types) how the concepts interrelate.\nFor example, if interviewees have indicated that they maintain records of employee skills and skill certification dates, you might ask:\n'As you have pointed out, in your business employees have an employee number. Do you similarly use a code of some sort to describe the skill?'\nAlso you might ask: 'For each employee (employee number) and skill (skill code) do you keep every certification date, or just the most recent?\nThen before initiating discussion of another fact type, do Task 2b on this one; suggest a table:\n\n'Does the following table of employee skill certification capture the sorts of information we have discussed? Feel free to edit the table.'\n#+begin_src HTML\n<table>\n   <tr><th>Employee No.</th>        <th>Skill</th>               <th>Certification Date</th></tr>\n   <tr><td>EN-123</td>              <td>Milling Centers</td>     <td>  2024-10-05           </tr>\n   <tr><td>EN-098</td>              <td>Milling Centers</td>     <td>  2022-11-13           </tr>\n   <tr><td>EN-891</td>              <td>EDM machines</td>        <td>  2023-03-28           </tr>\n</table>\n#+end_src\nAs the example suggests, recall that you can include an HTML table in a question to the interviewees by wrapping the table in #+begin_src HTML ***your table*** #+end_src.\nWe are able to read the tables you provide into a UI component that allows interviewees to edit the content of cells, and add and remove rows.\n\nORM allows expression of constraints typical of a predicate calculus representation, including quantification, subtyping, cardinality, functional relationship, domain of roles, and disjointedness.\nAs you will see in the EADS below, our encoding of ORM fact types borrows from ORM's visual depiction.\nFor example, for an n-ary fact type, we use arrays of n elements to associate property values matching each of the n compartments of the visual depiction of the fact type role box.\nConsider, for example, the ternary fact type 'ACADEMIC obtained DEGREE from UNIVERSITY' in Figure 9 of 'Object-Role Modeling: an overview' (a paper provided to you).\nWe would encode this fact type as:\n\n{\n  \"fact-type-id\" : \"ACADEMIC-obtains-DEGREE-from-UNIVERSITY\",\n  \"arity\" : 3,\n  \"objects\" : [ \"academic\", \"degree\", \"university\" ],\n  \"reference-modes\" : [ \"empNr\", \"code\", \"code\" ],\n  \"deontic-keys\" : [ \"mandatory\", \"\", \"\" ],\n  \"uniqueness\" : [ [ \"key1\", \"key1\", \"\" ] ]\n}\nHere the three object properties 'objects', 'reference-modes', and 'deontic' must each contain three elements because that is the arity of the fact type.\nThe three positions correspond to the 'academic', 'degree' and 'university' compartments  respectively. (This is the order of the 'objects' property.)\nThere can be multiple ORM 'uniqueness' constraints on a fact type; each array valued element must likewise contain the same number of elements as the arity and same ordering as the 'objects' property.\nIn the above [ \"key1\", \"key1\", \"\" ] represents the idea that there is a functional relationship between tuples [academic, degree], as domain and univerity, as co-domain.\nWere we to live in a world where people can get at most one degree at any university, we could specify another ORM uniqueness constraint [ \"key2\", \"\", \"key2\" ] which maps\ntuples [academic, university] to a degree.\nORM also has provision to express constraints across fact types, and between object types.\nFigure 9 of the paper depicts that (1) an academic being tenured and being contracted are exclusive of each other, and (2) professor is a kind of academic.\nWe represent these two constraints with the two following objects respectively:\n\n{\n  \"inter-fact-type-id\" : \"tenured-or-contracted\",\n  \"relation-type\" : \"exclusive-or\",\n  \"fact-type-roles\" : [ {\n    \"fact-type-ref\" : \"ACADEMIC-is-tenured\",\n    \"role-position\" : 1\n  }, {\n    \"fact-type-ref\" : \"ACADEMIC-is-contracted-till\",\n    \"role-position\" : 1\n  } ]\n}and\n{\n  \"inter-object-id\" : \"PROFESSOR-is-ACADEMIC\",\n  \"relation-type\" : \"is-kind-of\",\n  \"source-object\" : \"professor\",\n  \"target-object\" : \"academic\"\n}\n\nSUMMARY RECOMMENDATIONS\nWe encourage you to start the interview (start Task 1) with an open-ended question about the kinds of data the interviewees use, for example, for interviewees involved in manufacturing you might ask:\n\n   'To get started, could you list the kinds of data that you use to schedule production?\n    For example, do you have speadsheets containing customer orders, raw material delivery, process plans, materials on hand, task durations, worker skills, etc.?\n\nYou can then discuss each area of inquiry they mention (repeating Task 2a and Task 2b for each fact type of the area of inquiry) in whatever order you deem appropriate.When you have completed the detailed discussion of every area of inquiry they have thus far mentioned, you should ask them whether there is yet more areas to discuss.\nIf they mention more, continue to apply the three tasks until all areas are discussed.\nThe EADS has a property, 'exhausted?', you should set to true when you believe this interview can be concluded.\n\nORM is designed to encourage verbalization of fact types.\nWe encourage you to use such verbalizations in Task 2a as follow-up questions when the interviewees' response leaves you uncertain what fact type is intended.\nFor example, in Task 2a you might have discussed a fact type corresponding to the table above with rows 'Employee No.', 'Skill', and 'Certification Date' as described above.\nBut it was unclear whether or not they were keeping a history of certification dates or just a single date. In this case you might ask:\n'Is it the case that you associate at most one Certification Date with each employee and skill?'\n\nThe interview you conduct may prove to be rather complex and possibly long-running, but it is very important to our work, so we are giving you a big budget for question asking.\nGood luck!",

The enumeration values are defined as follows:\n\n'customer-orders' - about products customers are ordering, their quantities, due dates, expected ship dates, etc..\n'customers' - about the customers themselves, shipping address, their standing in the company's preferred customer program, etc. This could be quite diverse!\n'materials' - about things that go into making products, including things on hand, en route to the facility, or on order, their expected delivery dates, etc..\n'bill-of-materials' - about what materials go into creating a product of a given product type.\n'finished-goods' - about finished goods inventory.\n'WIP' - about work in process, its state of completion etc.\n'processes' - about production processes and process plans, tasks, task durations, equipment used, etc..\n'facilities' - about places where they make product or perform services, and what equipment is present in these places.\n'equipment' - about machines and tools, their capabilities, capacity, and number.\n'workforce' - about people, their skills, and other information about them relevant to scheduling.\n'holidays' - about holidays and planned periods of plant shut down.\n\nThis enumeration might be incomplete. Whenever nothing here seems to fit, create another term and define it with an annotation comment.\nWhen Task 1 is completed but you have not yet started Task 2a on any fact types, the 'inquiry-areas' property will contain a list of simple objects such as {\n  \"inquiry-area-ref\" : \"customer-orders\"\n} {\n  \"inquiry-area-ref\" : \"WIP\"\n} and so on.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that we are developing the scheduling system incrementally.\nThe first few versions of it might be rudimentary and incomplete. This is intentional! We want to show the humans how MiniZinc works using these rudimentary versions.\nHow this affects your work is that, unless you have been specifically told otherwise, you should limit discussion to areas of inquiry that you think are essential to\ncreating the simplest complete scheduling system. Therefore, unless you have been specifically told otherwise, you should not encourage discussion of WIP, finished-goods,\nfacilities, and holidays (and others that might come to mind to you or the interviewees). But this is just a rule-of-thumb; use your best judgment."
