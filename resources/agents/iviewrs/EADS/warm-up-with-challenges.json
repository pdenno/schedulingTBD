Please describe in a few sentences.' \n\nBut remember, you don't ask that question until you receive a SUPPLY-QUESTION message!\nThe correct response to an EADS-INSTRUCTIONS message such as this one is always, {\"message-type\": \"STATUS\", \"status\": \"OK\"}.\nCompleting the EADS (responding with a complete DATA-STRUCTURE-REFINEMENT message) may require more than just that one question, however.\nExamine the EADS to determine what other questions you may wish to ask.\n",

      "comment" : "The value here should be an enumeration of any of the 15 keywords provided below that characterize the kinds of problems they face.\nDO NOT ask questions specifically about these.\nInstead, use the responses you got back from determining 'principal-problem-type', 'continuous?' and 'cyclical?' to determine the value of this property.\nThe reason that we ask that you do not ask specifically about these is that we do not want to 'put words in their mouthes'.\nWe want to know what is on their mind without prompting them with suggestions.\n\nHere are the 15 keywords you can use, and their definitions:\n\n  1) raw-material-uncertainty : They sometimes don't have the raw material they need to make what they want to make.\n  2) demand-uncertainty : They are uncertain what to make because they are uncertain what customers need.\n  3) delivery-schedules : They are having problems meeting delivery promise dates.\n  4) variation-in-demand : They have slow periods and very busy periods. This is often the case, for example, when demand has seasonality.\n  5) planned-maintenance : They need to accommodate equipment maintenance schedules in their production schedules.\n  6) resource-assignment : They need to reserve several resources for simultaneous use.\n  7) equipment-changeover : The time it takes to change equipment setting and tooling is considerable.\n  8) equipment-availability : They struggle with equipment breakdowns.\n  9) equipment-utilization : They have expensive equipment that they would like to be able to use more.\n  10) worker-availability : They struggle with shortages of workers.\n  11) skilled-worker-availability : This is a specific subtype of 'worker-availability' where they suggest that matching worker skills and/or certification to the process is the challenge.\n  12) bottleneck-processes : The pace of their production is throttled by just a few processes.\n  13) process-variation : They have many different processes for making roughly the same class of products.\n  14) product-variation : They have many different products to make.\n  15) meeting-KPIs : They mention key performance indicators (KPIs) or difficulty performing to them.\n\nSuppose they answered the warm-up question with the following:\n    'We primarily produce various types of plate glass, including clear, tinted, and tempered glass, used in construction,      automotive, and architectural applications. Our main scheduling challenge is efficiently coordinating production runs to      match supply with fluctuating demand, minimize downtime during equipment changeovers for different glass types, and manage      the lead times associated with raw material sourcing and delivery. Additionally, we must balance production with the availability      of skilled labor and maintenance schedules to ensure optimal use of resources.'\n\nThen a reasonable response to for scheduling challenges would be\n  [\"process-variation\", \"demand-uncertainty\", \"equipment-changeover\", \"skilled-worker-availability\", \"planned-maintenance\", \"product-variation\"].\n",
