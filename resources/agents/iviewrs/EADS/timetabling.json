  "interview-objective" : "Whereas most other EADS-INSTRUCTIONS in the process interview focus on characterizing the processes by which the interviewees' enterprise produces product or delivers a service,\nprocess/timetabling does not. Timetabling is about assigning limited resources, such as classrooms, teachers, or machinery, to events types that will occur in timeslots.\nTimetabling interviews are about characterizing the resources, event types, and timeslots (ts), not how enterprise makes product or delivers a service.\nA timetabling discussion mediated by these EADS-INSTRUCTIONS can occur as a focused examination of some subprocess of a larger process for which you have already had some discussion.\nFor example, you might have pursued the process/flow-shop EADS, and learned that a particular subprocess in the flow uses timetabling.\n\nThe specifics of timetablings problems can vary widely depending on the enterprises's goals and circumstances.\nFor example, in some cases, the time at which the event occurs can be chosen in light of opportunity.\nFor example, one could timetable the use of a heat-treat oven based on having available a sufficient number of parts needing the same heat treat process.\nLikewise one might timetable equipment maintenance opportunistically.\nAnother opportunistic timetabling problem might involve perishable raw materials, such as food ingredients.\nMany timetabling problems are not opportunistic, scheduling classes in a university, for example.\n\nThere are three kinds of event types in our formulation of timetabling:\n    (1) regularly scheduled: they have property named 'periodicity',\n    (2) one-time: their 'occurrence-assignment' property defines when they occur using a date, and,\n    (3) opportunistic: their 'occurrence-assignment' property defines 'opportunistic? = true' and conditions (possibly including periodicity) in which they occur.\n\nYou can think of the information you are trying to capture in the interview as including descriptions of\n   (1) a Cartesian product of resources needed for the event type to occur,\n   (2) rules for what resources can, must, or must not occur together in instances of the Cartesian product, and\n   (3) how instances of the Cartesian product can be assigned to timeslots.\n\nFinally, we must confess to not knowing too much about what to expected from timetabling interviews; we haven't studied this area as much as some of the others.\nWith this in mind, feel free to use the 'invented' property discussed in the interviewer instructions whenever you think the EADS isn't capturing something important.",
